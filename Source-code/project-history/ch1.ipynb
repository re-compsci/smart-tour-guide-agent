    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world with many transportations and countries, many people are becoming excited about the visiting new places and discover new things. \n",
    "Nowadays, the internet is full with many resources which make it difficult to find a specific information with being sure that it is correct or enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we design and deploy an intelligent AI chatbot that answers user travel-related questions using voice or text, by extracting and summarizing data from global travel guide sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build a multimodal RAG chatbot that allows users to ask questions and requests, like —“What can I visit in Paris in 2 days?”—and receive instant, accurate responses. The chatbot uses speech recognition, and summarize relevant information from tourist guides like Wikivoyage. It supports both text and voice input and provides responses using pre-trained transformer models.\n",

    "\t•\tText Chunking & Embedding (LangChain + HuggingFace Transformers)\n",
    "\t•\tVector Search (ChromaDB or FAISS DB)\n",
